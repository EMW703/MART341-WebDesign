 Semantic elements can be used to edit words on a webpage. Some examples of semantic elements are italicizing words or putting words in bold.
 Structural elements have to do with the structure of a webpage. A good example of a structural element is  <ol>. <ol> allows the web page developer to make a numbered list.
